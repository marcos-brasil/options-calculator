'
'     A function for computing trivariate normal probabilities.
'     This function uses an algorithm given in the paper
'        "Numerical Computation of Bivariate and
'             Trivariate Normal Probabilities",

' CTND calculates the probability that X(I) < LIMIT(I), I = 1, 2, 3.
'
' Parameters
'
'   LIMIT  DOUBLE PRECISION array of three upper integration limits.
'   SIGMA  DOUBLE PRECISION array of three correlation coefficients,
'          SIGMA should contain the lower left portion of the
'          correlation matrix R.
'          SIGMA(1) = R(2,1), SIGMA(2) = R(3,1), SIGMA(3) = R(3,2).
'
'    CTND cuts the outer integral over -infinity to B1 to
'      an integral from -8.5 to B1 and then uses an adaptive
'      integration method to compute the integral of a bivariate
'      normal distribution function.
